Graphical Model for Grid-Based SLAM  	TODO: ADD GRAPHICAL MODEL HERE
Grid-Based Mapping with Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filters - Naive Approach andits Problems  	Naive Approach:- Each particle represents possible trajectory of robot- Each particle maintains own map=> updated per particle via "mapping with known poses"Problem:- Too many samples needed to sufficiently model motion noise- Increasing sample number difficult due to large grid maps==> Idea: Improve pose estimate BEFORE applying particle filter
Grid-Based SLAM: Pose Correction Using Scan Matching  	[latex]Maximize likelihood of current pose and map w.r.t previous pose and map\begin{equation*}x_{t}^{*} = arg\max \limits_{x_t} \{p(z_t|x_t, m_{t-1}) p(x_t|u_t, x_{t-1}^{*}\}\end{equation*}[/latex]
Grid-Based FastSLAM with Improved Odometry (Scan Matching):Properties  	- Scan matching = locally consistent pose correction- Pre-correct short Odometry sequences using scan-matching=> use as input to FastSLAM- Fewer particles needed, since smaller error in given inputInsight from Paper:Scan Matching has problems with large loop closures, since the pre-correctionof longer odometry sequences leads to large accumulated error (which in turneases wrong data association for the loop closure)
