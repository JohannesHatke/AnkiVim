Cyber-Physical systems: Fundamental problems  	[latex]\begin{enumerate}\item time matters ("as fast as possible" not good enough)\item intrinsic concurrency\begin{itemize}\item not an illusion (as in time sharing)\item not really about exploiting parallelism\end{itemize}\item environment $=$ physical\begin{itemize}\item continuous variables\item restricted to physical laws\end{itemize}\end{enumerate}[/latex]
Definition - Model  	[latex]artifact that imitates the system\\ \\mathematical model\begin{enumerate}\item defined in terms of formulas\item mathematical correctness statement\item formal, automatic, correctness proof\end{enumerate}[/latex]
Discrete vs Continuous vs Hybrid Systems (Graphical Depiction)  	TODO INSERT IMAGES FROM SLIDESET 02 SLIDE 10
Zeno Behaviour: Intuition + Definition (for Hybrid Automata) 	[latex]Intuition: system makes infinite number of jumps/transitions in finite time\\ \\Formally:\\An execution of a hybrid automaton with time set $\tau$ is zeno iff $\langle\tau \rangle = \infty $ but $|\tau| < \infty$.[/latex]
Why does Zeno Behaviour arise?  	[latex]\begin{itemize}\item our model is mathematical artifact\item zeno Behaviour possible mathematically, but impossible in reality\item some assumption in model must be unrealistic\end{itemize}[/latex]
Timed Automata - Intuition  	[latex]\begin{enumerate}\item right hand side of all differential equations of underlying systems is$1$:\begin{equation*}\stackrel{\cdot}{x} = 1\end{equation*}\item single-speed clocks that precisely track real time\item in jumps, clocks can be reset to time $0$ ($x:=0$)\end{enumerate}[/latex]
Definition: Time-abstract(Untimed) Trace  	[latex]A time-abstract (untimed) trace of $M$ is a sequence $q_0, q_1, q_2, \dots$that can be extended to a timed trace of $M$.\\($q_i$'s also may include input or output symbols)[/latex]
Verification vs Synthesis/Control  	[latex]Verification:\begin{itemize}\item does the system do what it's supposed to do/satisfy its specification?\end{itemize}Synthesis:\begin{itemize}\item construct a system that satisfies a given specification\end{itemize}Both need a specification that states the system objectives.[/latex]
