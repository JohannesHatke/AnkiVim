This tool is a small terminal application that serves as a wrapper to use vim 
(or the editor of your choice) to write anki cards quickly from the command line.

Requires: python2.7

Procedure to generate anki cards:

1. Call: python anki-vim -d DECKNAME
2. vim starts with preformatted card and cursor placed at the right spot. 

Start typing the front part of the anki card below "QUESTION", then fill out 
the back below "ANSWER". (NOTE: It is important to leave the QUESTION and ANSWER
headers intact throughout)

3. ":wq" to save the file and exit the editor.
=> the card contents are saved to decks/DECKNAME/raw_cards.txt

4. vim starts right back up to generate a new card for the same deck

=> Iterate 2.-4. until all cards are generated.

5. to stop the card creation process, simply close vim using ":q" or ":q!" or 
even ":wq" (the latter only without adding new content to the card")

Procedure to import anki cards generated by this tool into anki:

1. Open Anki
2. Generate the deck to import into or click on an existing deck
3. Click import and navigate to
   "....../anki-vim/decks/DECKTOIMPORT/raw_cards.txt"
4. Press enter and the cards should get imported and be ready for use.


Supports:
-> Plain text cards
-> Latex commands of any kind
-> Any editor (default is vim)


Working on:
-> support for media files

=> actually easy, all we need is: <img = src PATHTOFILE />

Of course, we don't want to type this, so the user may just type:

img=NAME (on its own line)

and then my parser can check:
- NAME = Full path if prefixed by / or ~
- NAME = Relative path else where full path = deckpath+"/"+"Images"+"/"+NAME

and Parser can copy all images to .../Anki/collection.media/ 
(to make sure it works with syncing)

(make sure to use unique names and find out how to locate ".../Anki" 
reliably for arbitary users)

-> bash script to enable deck autocompletion

-> improve snippet facilities

-> improve usability
